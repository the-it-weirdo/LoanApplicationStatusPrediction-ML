We trained 4 models viz. *‚ÄòKNN classifier model‚Äô, ‚ÄòNaive Bayes classifier model‚Äô, ‚ÄòDecision Tree classifier model‚Äô and ‚ÄòLinear Regression classifier model‚Äô* for binary classification based on the attributes present in the dataset and predict whether a loan application should be approved or not.

## About
- In this project we have a shortened ‚ÄòPredict Loan Application Status‚Äô Dataset from Kaggle. 
- In this dataset, the target attribute is the loan status which is in binary. So, we did a binary classification based on the attributes present in our dataset and predicted whether a loan application should be approved or not. 
- We found out the score, classification report, plotted the Receiver Operating Characteristic graph and found out the Area Under Curve (AUC) for each of the models trained. 
- We used the trained models to predict the outcomes using the given test dataset and compare the outcome of each model. 
- We choose the best model based on the accuracy score and classification report.
- Detailed report is in the pdf file located [here](https://github.com/the-it-weirdo/LoanApplicationStatusPrediction-ML/tree/master/Project%20Report%20and%20PowerPoint%20Presentation).
